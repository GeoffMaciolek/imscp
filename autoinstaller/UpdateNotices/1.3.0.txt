\Zb\Z1Update to version 1.3.0
=======================\Zn\ZB

\Zb\Z4# Database password (SQL root user password)\Zn\ZB

Because i-MSCP now uses the AES (Rijndael) algorithm in CBC mode to encrypt data (was Blowfish in CBC mode previously), the database keys file will be automatically regenerated and you'll be asked again for the SQL data.

\Zb\Z4# Panel's user passwords\Zn\ZB

Panel's user passwords are now hashed using the bcrypt algorithm. Previously, this was either md5-crypt, sha256-crypt or sha512-crypt, depending of the system capabilities.
The update is fully automatic. The password hashes are updated automatically on next successfull login.

Be aware that for safety reasons, the hashes created manually in database using the MD5() function are no longer accepted by the panel.
If you need to put a password hash manually in the database, you must generate it using the bcrypt algorithm.
For instance, you could use an online bcrypt generator such as: http://www.bcrypt-generator.com/
