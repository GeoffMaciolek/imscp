# i-MSCP 1.3.x -- Errata

## Update to version 1.3.0

### Database password (SQL root user password)

Because i-MSCP now uses the AES (Rijndael) algorithm in CBC mode to encrypt data (was Blowfish in CBC mode previously),
the database keys file will be automatically regenerated and you'll be asked again for the SQL data.

### Panel's user passwords

Panel's user passwords are now hashed using the bcrypt algorithm. Previously, this was either md5-crypt, sha256-crypt or
sha512-crypt, depending on the system capabilities. The update is fully automatic. The password hashes are updated
automatically on next successfull login.

Be aware that for safety reasons, the hashes created manually in database using the MD5() function are no longer
accepted by the panel. If you need to put a password hash manually in the database, you must generate it using the
bcrypt algorithm. For instance, you could use an online bcrypt generator such as: http://www.bcrypt-generator.com/

### Shared subtree (homedir)

Starting with this new version, the customer's home directories are automatically remounted on themselves as shared
subtree. Doing this allows the third-party softwares, such as the InstantSSH plugin, to replicate those subtrees where
they want, such as in a jailed environment. Then, a directory that is mounted later on in the shared subtree, such as an
httpd log folder, will be automatically propagated in the replicated mount point.
