# i-MSCP 1.3.x -- Errata

## Update to version 1.3.0

### Database password (SQL root user password)

Because i-MSCP now uses the AES (Rijndael) algorithm in CBC mode to encrypt data (was Blowfish in CBC mode previously),
the database keys file will be automatically regenerated and you'll be asked again for the SQL data.

### New IP addresses management
 
IP addresses that are added via the control panel are now automatically added into the network interface configuration
file (e.g: /etc/network/interfaces). Doing this allow us to no longer depend on the MySQL server when the server is
rebooted (the possibility of the MySQL server being unavailable for unknown reasons), and also, this provides a better
integration with the system (standard approach). To resume, IP addresses are now configured using interface definitions
in the network interface configuration file, instead of being configured on the fly using data pulled from the i-MSCP
database.
 
IP addresses are added in the network interface file using aliased (virtual) interfaces. Those types of interfaces have
names of the form interface:integer. To avoid collisions with manually configured interfaces, the i-MSCP network interface
provider uses integers starting at 1000. Thus, any IP addresses added through the i-MSCP control panel will have an entry
such as:
 
```
# i-MSCP [eth0:1002] entry BEGIN
auto eth0:1002
eth0:1001 inet static
        address <IP>
        netmask 255.255.255.255
# i-MSCP [eth0:1002] entry ENDING
```
 
**Warning:** You should never edit nor manually remove an entry from the network configuration file which has been added
by i-MSCP.
 
#### IP addresses manually configured
 
If some IP addresses were already configured by the administrator, it is always possible to add them in the control panel
for use with i-MSCP. In such case, the i-MSCP network interface provider will simply skip the configuration step. Be
aware that i-MSCP will not manage those IP addresses.
 
#### Netmask, Broadcast and Gateway
 
At this time, it's still not possible to setup the netmask, the broadcast and the gateway through the control panel.
This is a feature that will be implemented in a near future. However you should note that both options, the broadcast and
the gateway, are normally not needed when configuring virtual interfaces.

### Panel's user passwords

Panel's user passwords are now hashed using the bcrypt algorithm. Previously, this was either md5-crypt, sha256-crypt or
sha512-crypt, depending on the system capabilities. The update is fully automatic. The password hashes are updated on
next successfull login.

Be aware that for safety reasons, the hashes created manually in database using the MD5() function are no longer
accepted by the panel. If you need to put a password hash manually in the database, you must generate it using the
bcrypt algorithm. For instance, you could use an online bcrypt generator such as: http://www.bcrypt-generator.com/

### Services

### imscp_mountall service

This new service allows to mount i-MSCP filesystems when the server is rebooted. This service reads the entries in the
/etc/imscp/mounts/mounts.conf fstab-like file and processes them. Unlike the entries that are added in the system fstab
file, the entries added in this file are processed in sequential order.

### imscp_network service

This service, which was responsible to configure IP addresses on the fly and set iptables rules for the traffic logger,
has been removed.

### imscp_traffic service

This new service come in replacement of the imscp_network service. It sets iptables rules for the traffic logger when
the server is rebooted.

### Shared subtree (homedir)

The customer's home directories are now automatically remounted on themselves as shared subtree. Doing this allows the
third-party softwares, such as the InstantSSH plugin, to replicate those subtrees where they want, such as in a jailed
environment. Then, a directory that is mounted later on in the shared subtree, such as an httpd log folder, will be
automatically propagated in the replicated subtree.
